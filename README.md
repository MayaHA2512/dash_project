Dash Student Finance Tracker

Brief overview 

I developed a dash project to track student finances. In short - Dash is a web framework  primarily used to develop web applications. I felt this would be a great opportunity to test its capabilities to set up a financial tracker as it requires little to no CSS and is fully Python based. This makes it a great tool to use alongside the Object Orientated Programming (OOP)
paradigm as you can separate the different components of the application using the model view controller (MVC) structure and pull methods from the Model class(business logic) and View class(UI) into the controller when creating your callbacks. Please note - callbacks are what make components such as toggles and graphs in your UI interactive.
